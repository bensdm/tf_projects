# Chapter 7: LSTM stock prediction


## Description

Time series analysis is a very important topic in data science: forecasting future sales, earning, expenses, but also failures and losses is key in today's finance departments. In this chapter we will explore how to predict the future of a monodimensional signal, a stock price. Given its past, we will learn how to forecast its future with a LSTM architecture, and how we can make the prediction more and more accurate. Source of data: Yahoo finance.
