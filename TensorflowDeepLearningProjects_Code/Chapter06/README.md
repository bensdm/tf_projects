# Chapter 8: Create and Train Machine Translation systems


## Description

How many times have we searched the translation of a sentence in a different language? I guess many. Have you noticed that the quality of the translation had steadily improved since  deep learning libraries has arrived? Currently the translation provided by machine is extremely good, and we're going to see in this chapter how to create and train a bleeding edge machine translation system with Tensorflow.
