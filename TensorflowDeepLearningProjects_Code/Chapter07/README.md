# Chapter 9: Chapter 9 - Train and set up a Chatbot, able to discuss like a human


## Description
Many apps, websites, helplines and software nowadays use a chat-based agent to reply to user inputs. Chatbots understand the user input, interpret the request, retrieve the reply, formulate an output and sintetize it in plain English to the users, retaining the context. Chatbots are one of the most advanced AI interfaces, very close to pass Turing test. In this chapter we will see how to build an intelligent chatbot from scratch and how to "discuss" wit it.
