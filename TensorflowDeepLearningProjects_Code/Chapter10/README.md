# Chapter 12: Winning at Video Games by Reinforcement learning

## Description
The chapter details a project where you build an AI capable of playing Pacman by itself and winning. The project revolves around the existing OpenAI Gym project and integrates it using Tensorflow. OpenAI Gym is a project providing different gaming environments to explore how to use AI agents that can be powered, among other algorithms, by Tensorflow neural models. The Gym is part of a larger project, the OpenAI Universe,  allowing anyone to build autonomous bots that can learn to play at very different videogames, getting a bit beyond the usual narrow AIs, from classic Atari video games to the brand new ones.  The purpose of the project illustrated in this chapter is to build a general AI that be trained to successfully on Pacman but that can work also for much different games offered by the OpenAI Gym framework.
