# Chapter 4: Building GANs to produce handwritten characters for a conditional image creation

## Description
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (also GANs for short) are a novel deep learning technique that allow a computer to generate reasonably plausible image, video, sound (or generally data) artifacts. GANs use two neural networks, one for producing the artifacts and another for evaluating (discriminating) their being plausible or not.  Not dissimilarly from reinforcement learning, the generative network receives positive feedbacks only when its reproduced images are reputed plausible by the other network, that is when it cannot correctly identify them. That allows the creation of sometimes evocative, sometimes very realistic novel images. In this project the reader will be guided step by step in building a selective GANs for reproducing new images of the favored kind. The used datasets that GANs will reproduce will be hand written characters (both number and letters in the Chars74K http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/ or EMNIST https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) and faces in the wild (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).
